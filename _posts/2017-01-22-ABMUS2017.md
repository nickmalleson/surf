# CfP: International Workshop on Agent-based modelling of Urban Systems (ABMUS2017)


**The [ABMUS2017](http://modelling-urban-systems.com/) workshop on Agent-based modelling of urban systems will be held at the [AAMAS2017](http://aamas2017.org/) conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil on 8-9 May 2017.**

Researchers and practitioners who use agent-based models and agent systems to understand, explore, and manage cities and urban infrastructure systems are invited to submit papers to ABMUS2017. The overarching theme for the workshop is data for agent-based models. Data is essential for building, calibrating, and validating agent-based city and urban infrastructure models. But which approaches are optimal for what purposes? We invite presentations that describe data collection and data management approaches in agent-based models, as well as the use of data sets and methodologies that can be translated and re-used between researchers, sectors and countries.

Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

 - Large scale urban simulation applications
 - Agent-based modelling of urban transport, land-use, housing, energy, health, etc.
 - Spatially explicit micro-simulation modelling
 - Simulation of household behaviour and technology adoption
 - Localized population synthesis
 - Multi-scale urban systems (temporal and spatial)
 - Social simulation of demographic transitions
 - Use of mobile technology to validate activity patterns
 - Techniques for integrating independently developed components
 - Agent-based platforms for urban simulation
 - Data structures for simulating urban environments
 - (Multi-)agent systems for decision support in e.g. transport, energy use and air quality
 - Connection of simulation models to social and geographical theory
 - Development of ‘master’ city datasets for model validation

At the workshop each presenter will be given 10 minutes to introduce their paper and/or case study, followed by 5-10 minutes in which presenters will share their views on the data for agent-based models theme. After three presentations there will be 20-30 minutes of group discussion in which presenters will act as panel members.
